    <th>⭒Two very important aspects to do designing anime and manga Characters:⭒</th>
    <th>Decide on what your character will be</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>But what makes a strong character? How can we see their design and have an instant feeling of appeal? There’s really no “magic” formula…

      At least, not one that would conversely have the magic feel very artificial.
      
      So then how do we create interesting and fun characters? Well, aside from avoiding too many common tropes, I’ve got 7 guidelines to help you with your character creation.
      
      Sketch them small at first (thumbnail drawing)
      
      Mark the best ones and draw them larger
      
      Create variants on your second drawing
      
      Think in terms of shape design
      
      Write down or mull over the backstory
      
      Explore the Character in various other drawings
      
      Never get too attached
      
      In this video, I touch on all of these tips and more:
      Sketch them small at first (thumbnail drawing):

Creating tiny drawings sparks a flurry of ideas, and they’re really fast to make. Refer to the video for a demo.

Mark the best ones and draw them larger:

The most appealing thumbnails will generally make the most appealing finals. When you scale up the little drawing, all those ideas can be more fleshed out. Take the things you love about the little one, and keep their essence strong as you re-draw.

Create variants on your second drawing:

Once you’ve done the drawing, keep trying different variants on the charcters hair, clothes, accessories, skin color, etc…You might not fall in love with just one of the versions, and have to mix n’ match for the best result.

Think in terms of shape design:

Shapes inform the viewer. They say things like “This character is sharp.” or “This character is round and approachable.” Or even “This character is detailed and dangerous.” Shapes will permit us to access these feelings. A triangular hat, a square wristband, it’s all about knowing when to deploy each shape for the effect desired.

Write down or mull over the backstory:

If you’re feeling stuck visually, then thinking with words can generate more ideas. in the “Modern Druid” example, I was verbally musing, and it helps as well. If you can write down stats like height and weight, or even a paragraph or two on the character’s bio, you’ll feel more assured on the picture plane.

Explore the Character in various other drawings:

Portraits, action shots, quiet moments, expressions…all are valid ways to test the character out. Disney artists were great at this, and many Anime artists have sheets upon sheets of these types of character drawings.

Never get too attached:

Be willing to start over, or renovate large parts of the work. It can get to the “too fussy” point, but I’m more than willing to bet that the design will be stronger for it. Don’t worry about demolishing the work if you know you’re not happy with it yet.

CONCLUSION:
Pretty fun, no? This was a really exciting process to go through. It’s one of my favorite things to create new characters, and it’s usually far more exciting than rendering a painting for 20 hours or something. 

Once you’ve got a solid character, you can begin to showcase them in various ways in a series of works. 

Or, you can weave them into a larger story of your own imaginings. 

Regardless, I hope that these tips serve you well as a creator. However, If you find you’re struggling too much, it’s likely you need to study up on your character drawing basics.

       <td>If you're working on drawing your own manga or even if you just want to write a fanfic for your favorite anime or manga, you'll want to make a character who is interesting and makes people want to read your story (without becoming a Mary Sue!). wikiHow can show you how to write interesting characters, as well as teach you how to draw them! Get started with Step 1 below or check out the Table of Contents above for more specific help.
        1
        Decide their blood type. Blood type is seen as a common indicator of personality in Japan. You can use this as a way to help decide what you want your character to be like. The blood types and associated personalities are:
        O - confident, optimistic and strong-willed but also self-centered and unpredictable
        A - creative, reserved and responsible but also stubborn and tense
        B - active and passionate but also selfish and irresponsible
        AB - adaptable and rational but also forgetful and critical
        2
        Decide their birth date. The Western Zodiac or the Eastern Zodiac can both also be used to determine personality. You can use this to choose your character's age or birth year and their birth date.
        3
        Use the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. If you really want to get an idea for a fully formed personality, you can check out the Myers-Briggs personality test. These personality types, based in the study of psychology, can be helpful in fleshing out your character's personality.
        4
Use a personality balancer. You'll also want to be sure to balance your character's personality. A balance of positive and negative traits is necessary to create a compelling, believable character. Count up your character's negative traits and positive traits and try to make the negative traits slightly outnumber the positive ones. By the end of your story, your character will have developed to overcome a few of the negative traits. Example negative traits include:
Manipulative
Often lies
Insults others
Uncaring about their impact on others
Focused on only their own goals
Has poor impulse control
Frequently resentful, even of small or accidental slights
Is usually reckless or impulsive
5
Give them a great name. Many people also believe that someone's name can affect their personality. Studies show that having an uncommon name can lead to bullying and the personality issues that result from being bullied. There are also people who believe a name can determine your whole personality (called Kabalarians). This, whether true or not, can help you decide on a name.
Try to avoid using really unusual names in an otherwise realistic setting. This makes your character seem out of place.
1
Identify your character's ending goal. Where do you want your character to end up? What do you want their lesson to be over the course of your story? What do you want them to have learned or changed? You can use your character's ending state to figure out how to portray them in the beginning.
2
Identify your character's beginning. Once you know where they end up, decide where you want them to start out. This should follow logically from where they end. For example, if you want a character that learns to appreciate others, you want to show them not appreciating the people that care about them in the beginning. You probably also want to show why they think they don't need people.
3
Decide how they get there. Think about where you want them to start and end. Now, what would lead someone to change like that? This is where you can get some great ideas for your story, because the things that happen to your character to make them change makes for great plot or subplot.
4
Avoid the clichés. Their girlfriend gets killed. They were orphaned at a young age. They grew up the perpetual new kid. These are all clichés meant to jump start your character's development. And because they're clichès, they tend to be boring. Try to avoid them. Work to be original in your character development. This will make people more interested in your character and want to follow your story </td>
