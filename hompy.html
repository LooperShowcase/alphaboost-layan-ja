<p> you can’t tell visually since there are different art styles in different anime.

Leaving out chibi-style art and magical or alien characters who only look young, it is still difficult to tell unless you know the context (college, out of college, high school, junior high, etc) or know their ages.

Some artists make junior high kids look like their are in their late teens or early 20s.

Others make adults look like kids. One example is the teacher, presumably in her early 20s, in “School Live.” She looks like she should be in junior high and at first I thought the high school students in that anime were in junior high or elementary school. She’s just drawn to look much younger, she isn’t an immortal nor a very smart kid who went to college early and graduated with a teaching degree while others her age were still in junior high.

If you look at those characters and the characters in the same age group in the similar themed anime “High School of the Dead” the characters in the latter look much older even though the main characters in both shows are all high school students. </p>

    <p>So something I was thinking about and wondering if anyone knows why on.

      Lots of characters, male and female, in anime and video games, for story reasons are in highschool or the like. "Cusp of adult hood," "coming of age" ect. But then they have the bodies of like, 20-somethings. They don't look like kids; nor do I feel bad if I find them attractive for that reason. I'm not talking about lolis, I'm talking about your classic shonen/ect anime protagonists. (I feel like Bleach has a lot of this, for one popular example? But it's like everywhere.)
      
      How come this happens so much? Do artists just want to draw older characters? Is it just for the sex appeal? Have any prominent artists ever said anything in interviews? Am I just bad judging ages and these characters look highschool aged to everyone else?</p>

          Quotes
“	Something is... ...wrong... ...with me. For as long as I can remember, I've always felt...empty. Incomplete. Like a part of me is...missing. This hollow feeling has dominated my life. I've never been able to feel anything else. My world has always been cold...dark...silent. My mother was exactly like me when she was a child. But when she met my father, everything changed for her. He brought warmth and color and life into her world. He made her...complete. She told me that, one day, I'd meet someone special, just like she did. Someone who would cure me...fix me...save me. I've spent my entire life waiting for that day... ...dreaming of the moment when I'd meet the person who would complete me. It was the only thing for me to look forward to. It was my only reason to live. And then...one day... ...I found him. When I met him, something changed inside of me. My world was filled with colors and light. It was like I had opened my eyes for the first time. I felt warm. I felt complete. I felt...alive. He is my escape from the cold, grey, empty world I've been trapped in. He is the one I've been waiting for... The person I want to spent the rest of my life with. But... ...someone...is trying to take him from me. She wants him, but not in the same way that I want him. She could never appreciate him the way I do. She doesn't deserve him. He belongs to me. I have to stop her. Even if it means hurting her. Even if it means killing her. There is nothing I won't do for him. I won't let anyone come between us. I don't care what I have to do. I don't care who I have to hurt. I don't care whose blood I have to spill. I won't let anyone take him from me. Nothing else matters. No one else matters. He will be mine. He doesn't have a choice.	”
 	
— Ayano's monologue in the current intro cutscene.
She will be 107 years old in 2017. It has also been a family tradition for several centuries that when an Aishi woman marries a man, the man always adopts the wife's surname. It is most likely that there are no male yanderes in the family.
Yandere-chan has fair skin, black hair that is tied into a ponytail and grey-blackish eyes. She is 165 cm tall (5 feet, 5 inches), 43.5 kg (95.90 lbs), and has average-sized breasts. She's seen wearing a white and navy blue uniform shirt with a red mini scarf, a matching navy blue skirt, black stockings and black shoes. Her uniform can be customized. In all uniforms except for Female Uniform #5, she wears her signature black hip-high socks.
My friend and I were talking about Yandev and the ages of the characters and we managed to confuse ourselves

I know the porn games state she's 18 but I've also seen some people state she's 17.

I like to think she's 18, considering porn and body pillow shit but I'm not even sure.

I think part of my confusion came from the game's stupid disclaimer that claims that everyone is 18 even when Yandev says otherwise, which is just....what?
